# The gentoo penguins and their breeding patterns.  
## Goal 
    The goal of this project was to show whether gentoo penguins are breeding at a higher rate or not using data from https://www.penguinmap.com/. 

## My findings
    I learned that gentoo penguins overall are increasing in population throughout various colonies. I also learned that researchers can measure successful breeding, by dividing the number of penguin chicks to the number of nests (instances of breeding). I incorpated this chick-nest ratio in one of my graphs. 

## Data collection process
I collected data from Oceanites.org who run a penguin map. The data was thankfully already in a csv format. I used pandas to clean the data and specifically look into where gentoo penguins and chinstrap penguins were located. Many research articles compared gentoo penguins to chinstrap penguins given that they share common habits and are part of the same penguin family. So, I also used pandas to see where chinstrap were located and how their overall breeding rates and population were doing in comaprsion to gentoo penguins. 

## Data analysis process
I did speak to Dr. Grant Humphries via email to first understand what sites to focus on when analyzing gentoo penguins. Humphries also provided background information on the gentoo penguins, including how they are adaptive to the changing climate. I used bar charts to analyze the data because I was looking, across time, how the breeding and overall population of the two penguins were. Initially I had done line graphs, but I avoided using this approach given we cannot assume correlation. Also, some years had missing data so a line graph would not be the best approach. 

## Growth
I enjoyed working with this dataset! This was the first time I worked with Datawrapper. I learned that switching my columns and deciding what are my x axis and y axis helps when graphing with datawrapper. If you don't accruately explain which columns to graph, Datawrapper won't support you. This experience was different from ggplot, which prefers long data versus wide. 

## Setbacks
For a first time project, time was my biggest enemy. I got way too caught up, perhaps overly excited, on how my graphs should look. I will definetly manage my time better next time. Also, I would love to use ggplot and see if I can make a time lapse bar chart to show 30 plus years worth of data on gentoo penguin population per site.
